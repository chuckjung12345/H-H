    <p>Your Board has promised to hold regular Listening Sessions with members to allow you to tell us what’s on your mind. Here’s how we plan to implement this.</p>

    <p>First—a reminder: our primary goal at these meetings is for us to listen and bring back to the full Board what we have heard from you.</p>

    <p>Each month, approximately 10–14 days before the next Board meeting, there will be an open “sign-up.” Like reserving a tee time or other event, the “sign-up” will become available at an announced time and date and will inform you of the date and time of the meeting. Members will sign up, indicating a desire to participate and a few days later, from those who signed up, and on a “first come, first taken” basis, groups of 4–6 members will be formed. Members selected will be notified and asked to confirm they will participate. Each group of members will be assigned to a BOG team.</p>

    <p>We have put together three two-person BOG teams:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>John Gahan / Lou Righi</li>
      <li>Rick Casali / Pat Glenday</li>
      <li>George Hribar / Edie Stevenson</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The meetings in September will be held as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gahan/Righi – September 11 – 9:30–10:30 – HOA Conf Room</li>
      <li>Casali/Glenday – September 11 – 10:30–11:30 – HOA Conf Room</li>
      <li>Hribar/Stevenson – September 12 – 2:00–3:00 – HOA Conf Room</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The sign-up will open on September 3, 2025, and end on September 5.</p>
