    <h1>Mariner Sands Tornado</h1>
    <p>On October 9, 2024 Mariner Sands was hit by the tornado aftermath of Hurricane Milton. Sixty homes in our community sustained damage. Of these, 43 homes received noticeable exterior damage, some severe, and 6 homes were destroyed or leveled. The areas most affected included Spy Glass Lane, Medinah Lane and Burning Tree Circle.</p>
    <p>In addition, the damage to landscaping, shrubs, trees, fencing and pool cages was significant to the homeowners, golf courses and our surroundings. All of us recognize the impact to our beautiful community.</p>
    <p><strong>Everyone is grateful that there was no loss of life.</strong></p>
    <p>We owe a debt of thanks to the First Responders and Martin County Sheriffs who immediately came to our community to search for the injured. They brought equipment to assist homeowners and opened our roadways for access. Within days, the National Guard was here to assist.</p>
    <p>Our own security staff worked overtime to help and to guard our perimeters. Within days our common area maintenance crew and the golf maintenance crew jumped into action to remove the debris. The Chapel was organized to assist and the House of Hope, one of the charities Mariner Sands supports during Charity Week, came to help us with water, food and household supplies.</p>
    <p>Our own members assisted in all these efforts, and they opened their homes to members. Neighbors helping neighbors were truly in action here.</p>
    <p>Many homes lost power for days. FPL and Hotwire were here trying to get power up. It took some days to accomplish this. Our garbage services were strained with all the food items that had to be thrown out.</p>
    <p>When power was restored to the Sandbar we were able to meet for food, drinks, support and comradery.</p>
    <p>In the aftermath a town Hall was held in the Chapel by the Board to get information and guidance on the rebuilding process. The ARB jumped in to handle the heavy workload. The residents who were affected joined together to share info on how and when to get assistance with insurance, Martin County regulations, general contractors, etc.</p>
    <p>We received heavy media coverage from local and national media sources. Friends and family contacted us all concerned about our well-being.</p>
    <p>Although this event is not yet over for many of our members, we are hopeful for the future. Most of all we are thankful for our neighbors and celebrate the Mariner Sands community.</p>
    <p><strong>Your Board of Governors,</strong></p>
