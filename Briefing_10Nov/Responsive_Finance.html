<div class="sal">Dear Fellow Member:</div>

<p>
Attached you will find Mariner Sands unaudited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2025.
The balance sheet shows that our liquidity remains good. As of June 30, we had approximately $4.9 million
in operating cash and over $10.7 million in cash and short-term investments in our capital reserve accounts.
The capital reserve accounts as of June 30 are as follows:
</p>

<div class="table-wrap" role="region" aria-label="Capital reserve balances (read-only, scrollable)">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Reserve Account</th>
        <th class="num">Current Year</th>
        <th class="num">Prior Year</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Clubhouse Renovation Fund</td><td class="num">$5,281,986</td><td class="num">$6,778,458</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Golf Facilities Reserve</td><td class="num">$3,649,084</td><td class="num">$3,637,883</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Common Area Reserve</td><td class="num">$1,372,171</td><td class="num">$1,197,675</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Road Replacement Reserve</td><td class="num">$37,646</td><td class="num">$318,237</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Storm Drainage Reserve</td><td class="num">$283,214</td><td class="num">$271,792</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Certificate Redemption</td><td class="num">$93,667</td><td class="num">$52,834</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<p>
Most of the significant changes in the balance sheet relate to the new clubhouse. As noted above,
the clubhouse renovation fund is lower than the prior year, while both the property and equipment and
debt balances are much higher than the prior year. Despite the fact that clubhouse is open, as of June 30,
there were still amounts in trade accounts payable and bills not yet received that will reduce the above
clubhouse renovation fund. As I noted in my letter of January 29, 2025, the clubhouse renovation fund will
also be used to make debt service payments on the bank loan.
</p>

<p>
Operating income for the year, shown on page 2 of the enclosed financial report, shows an operating loss of $78,169.
This is favorable to budget, but the prior year reported a small profit. Some of the loss is caused by the inclusion
of payroll costs related to the hurricane/tornado that is required to be shown in operations, despite the fact that it
was covered by the assessment shown in other revenue on page 3. The deficiency of revenue over expenses before member’s
equity transactions shown on page 3 is a loss of $1,667,668, favorable to budget, but again a greater loss than in the
prior year. The increased loss over the prior year is primarily due to the road paving work carried out this year.
The large amount shown as favorable to budget is due to several items as noted in my letter of April 29, 2025 and relate
primarily to interest expense and depreciation.
