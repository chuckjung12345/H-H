  <h1>ARB ANNOUNCES EXTERIOR HOME INSPECTIONS WILL START IN NOVEMBER 2025</h1>

  <p>The ARB conducts periodic exterior home inspections to ensure all homeowners comply with the rules in our covenants and By-Laws regarding exterior maintenance. Our goal is to provide early, helpful notice of any necessary exterior maintenance or repairs, giving homeowners plenty of time to address issues as the season gets underway. The following is an overview of when the inspections will be conducted and the areas that will be inspected:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Exterior home inspections</strong> will be conducted community-wide for all homes from November 1 through 15th and include the front and back of each home.</li>
    <li>The key areas included in the November inspection are:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Roof</strong> – cleaning and repairs needed</li>
        <li><strong>Driveways</strong> – cleaning and rust removal, repairs, and weed removal</li>
        <li><strong>Mailboxes</strong> – correct paint colors on boxes, numbers, and condition of mailbox post; also, if the mailbox needs repair/replacement. Plantings around the mailbox should not be more than 18” in height.</li>
        <li><strong>Mulch</strong> is installed in each landscape bed, surrounding the entire house. The allowed color is dark brown or black.</li>
        <li><strong>Landscaping</strong> – mowing, pruning, clearing underbrush, weeds, or other unsightly growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Rust</strong> – removal of rust stains on driveways, walkways, mailboxes, and homes is required. If you have significant rust staining and it is encroaching onto the Miami gutters and road, you should have your water system checked to see how you can correct off-site rust deposits and runoff. Additionally, if your rust staining is from an adjoining home, you should contact the homeowner to address their rust issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Equipment</strong> – A/C, generator, pool, and irrigation equipment must be screened to avoid being visible from the street or golf course.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Mariner Sands maintains standards to address exterior improvements, and the ARB is here to ensure compliance with the HOA Article 8 Bylaw and the ARB Criteria. Please refer to the up-to-date ARB Criteria found on the Mariner Sands website under: <strong>My Club → Resources → Architectural Review Board</strong>. It contains the guidelines and policies which the inspections are reviewed upon and the procedure by which you can address issues.</p>

  <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> All exterior work requires ARB approval prior to the commencement of work. The ARB group is here to assist the homeowners and the community with the review process. If you have any questions, please let us know or contact the HOA office for further information.</p>
